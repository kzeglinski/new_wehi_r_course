Perform basic data analyses in R\n:::\n\n## Introduction\n\nFor our analysis, we will use the `dosage` and `genes` data frames, which contain information about the mice treated with mousezempic and their gene expression levels, respectively.\n\nThe first thing we need to do is load the packages we'll need for today:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# tidyverse package contains most of what we need\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n# let's also load patchwork to put plots together\nlibrary(patchwork)\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnd read in the two datasets:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# read in dosage data\ndosage <- read_csv(\"data/mousezempic_dosage_data.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nRows: 344 Columns: 9\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (4): mouse_strain, cage_number, replicate, sex\ndbl (5): weight_lost_g, drug_dose_g, tail_length_mm, initial_weight_g, id_num\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# read in expression data\ngenes <- read_tsv(\"data/mousezempic_expression_data.tsv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nRows: 343 Columns: 11\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \"\\t\"\nchr  (1): group\ndbl (10): Th_rep1, Th_rep2, Th_rep3, Prlh_rep1, Prlh_rep2, Prlh_rep3, Hprt1_...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"How do we read in data again?\"}\nNote that we used `read_csv()` for the mouse dosage data and `read_tsv()` for the expression data.

Each mouse has a unique ID number (`id_num` column), which matches with those in the `dosage` dataset, but there are also additional control mice, who have not received mousezempic (as described in the `group` column).\n\n### Today's research questions {#sec-research-questions}\n\nIn today's session, we will use the `dosage` and `genes` datasets to explore the following questions:\n\n1.  Does the amount of weight lost by mice increase as dosage of mousezempic increases? Is this relationship affected by the mouse strain or sex?\n2.  How does mousezempic affect the expression of the TH and PRLH genes? Is the expression of either of these genes correlated with the amount of weight mice lose?\n\nOf course, there are countless questions we could ask of our data! In the interest of time, we will stick to these two key analyses but various others are explored in the practice questions at the end of this session's notes.\n\n## Tidy data {#sec-tidy-data}\n\nIn order to answer the research questions outlined above (or any others for that matter), we need to ensure that our data is **\"tidy\"**.\n\nThis is because the tidyverse packages we are using revolve around the concept of \"[tidy data](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-tidy.html)\", which is a specific way of organising data into a table so that it is easy to work with. Tidy data is roughly defined as tabular data that contains:\n\n1.  Individual variables in columns\n2.  Individual observations in rows\n3.  One data value in each cell\n\nIn other words, each column in our datasets should represent a particular measurement (like expression of the TH gene or the sex of the mice), and each row should contain all of the measurements available for a particular mouse.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"*Why* is tidy data easy to work with?\"}\n[This cartoon from Allison Horst](https://allisonhorst.com/other-r-fun) sums it up well: ![Tidy data can be analysed in a more routine/systematic manner](images/S04F01_tidy_data.jpg){width=\"80%\"}\n:::\n\nAlthough tidy data is the easiest to work with, it's often necessary to alter the format of your data for plotting or table displays. It's a good idea to keep your core data in a tidy format and treating plot or table outputs as representations of that tidy data.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Data wrangling?\"}\nMost data you encounter will not be tidy, so the first part of data analysis is usually called \"data wrangling\" or \"data cleaning\" and involves tidying up your data (by \"wrangling\" it into shape) so it is easier to use for downstream analysis. In this session, we will practice data wrangling by tidying up the `genes` data frame.\n:::\n\n## Reshaping and combining data (to make it tidy) {#sec-reshaping}\n\nIn session 2, we learned a range of functions that work on either the rows or columns of our data: `filter()`, `select()`, `mutate()` and `summarise()`. By cleverly combining these functions you can answer a lot of different questions about your data, but sometimes you may need to reshape or even combine different datasets to get the *right* rows and columns. In this section, we will cover how the `pivot`, `separate` and `join` families of functions can be used to help us get our data in the right (tidy!) format to answer the research questions outlined above.\n\n### Reshaping data with pivot functions {#sec-pivot}\n\nPivoting is a way to change the shape of your data:\n\n-   Pivoting **longer** reshapes the data to transfer data stored in columns into rows, resulting in more rows and fewer columns.\n\n-   Pivoting **wider** is the reverse, moving data from rows into columns.\n\n![Pivot functions allow you to change the structure of your data frame](images/S04F02_pivot.png){width=\"50%\"}\n\nAs shown in the figure above, we use the `pivot_longer()` function to pivot data from wide to long format, and the `pivot_wider()` function to pivot data from long to wide format.\n\n#### Pivot wider\n\nA common use case for `pivot_wider()` is to make a [contingency table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_table), which shows the number of observations for each combination of two variables. This is often easier to read than the same information in long format.\n\nFor example, before we can address our first research question of whether the relationship between weight lost and drug dosage is affected by mouse strain or sex, we probably want to check that we have sufficient *n* for each mouse strain/sex combination. We can achieve this in a long format using `summarise()` as we learned in session 2:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndosage %>%\n  summarise(n_mice = n(), .by = c(mouse_strain, sex))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 8 × 3\n  mouse_strain sex    n_mice\n  <chr>        <chr>   <int>\n1 CD-1         male       73\n2 CD-1         female     73\n3 CD-1         <NA>        6\n4 Black 6      female     58\n5 Black 6      male       61\n6 Black 6      <NA>        5\n7 BALB C       female     34\n8 BALB C       male       34\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis summarises by each combination of `mouse_strain` and `sex`, with the `n()` function giving the count of data belonging to that combination.\n\nTo get a contingency table, we want the rows to represent one categorical variable (in this case `sex`) and the columns to represent another categorical variable (in this case `mouse_strain`), with the values in the cells being the counts (coming from the `n_mice` column). In doing so, our table will become wider, because we are adding additional columns. So, we can use the `pivot_wider()` function to create our contingency table.\n\n`pivot_wider()` requires two pieces of information:\n\n1.  `names_from`, which is the column that the new columns will come from\n2.  `values_from`, which is the column that the values of the cells will come from\n\nIn this case, our `names_from` will be `mouse_strain`, and `values_from` will be `n_mice`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndosage %>%\n  summarise(n_mice = n(), .by = c(mouse_strain, sex)) %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = mouse_strain, values_from = n_mice)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 3 × 4\n  sex    `CD-1` `Black 6` `BALB C`\n  <chr>   <int>     <int>    <int>\n1 male       73        61       34\n2 female     73        58       34\n3 <NA>        6         5       NA\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis has transformed our data into a contingency table, with `NA` used to indicate where no data corresponding data exists for the specific `sex` and `mouse_strain` combination. It allows us to see that we have a decent number of mice for each strain/sex, giving us confidence that we can address whether or not these variables affect the relationship between drug dosage and weight loss.\n\n#### Pivot longer\n\nAlthough wide format data is easy to read, it is difficult to use tidyverse functions on because of how variables are stored in column names rather than in columns of their own. For example, in the contingency table we created above, the different strains of the mice are now in the names of the columns. Another example of this is in our new `genes` dataset, where the gene names and replicates are both encoded as column names:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngenes\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 343 × 11\n   group        Th_rep1 Th_rep2 Th_rep3 Prlh_rep1 Prlh_rep2 Prlh_rep3 Hprt1_rep1\n   <chr>          <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>      <dbl>\n 1 grp_treatme…   3239.   5964.   4123.      225.      359.      314.       858.\n 2 grp_treatme…   2665.   4867.   4240.      253.      460.      358.       709.\n 3 grp_treatme…   1536.   2501.   2054.      367.      552.      448.       975.\n 4 grp_treatme…   2732.   4800.   3981.      258.      411.      339.       725.\n 5 grp_treatme…   2384.   3460.   3115.      347.      651.      491.       896.\n 6 grp_treatme…   2972.   4880.   4028.      303.      456.      377.       865.\n 7 grp_treatme…   1936.   3666.   2964.      302.      441.      355.       625.\n 8 grp_treatme…   2801.   4977.   3795.      246.      424.      321.       856.\n 9 grp_treatme…   3239.   5198.   3930.      385.      654.      508.       623.\n10 grp_treatme…   2665.   3820.   2958.      230.      391.      301.       740.\n# ℹ 333 more rows\n# ℹ 3 more variables: Hprt1_rep2 <dbl>, Hprt1_rep3 <dbl>, id_num <dbl>\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis can be pretty tricky to work with--- we'd have to type out all of the `Th_rep1 Th_rep2 Th_rep3` columns every time we want to do something with the TH gene, and if we ever wanted to re-use the code for a different gene or a different number of replicates we'd need to change the column names accordingly. Instead, it would be better to have a column for gene name, and another column for the replicate so that we can write code that will cope with any number of different genes and replicates.\n\nTo achieve this, we can use the `pivot_longer()` function, which will create a pair of new columns from the original column name and the value of the corresponding cell. `pivot_longer()` requires three different arguments:\n\n1.  `cols`: the columns to pivot from. You can use selection helpers like `contains()` or `starts_with()` to easily select multiple columns at once.\n2.  `names_to`: the name of a new column that will contain the original column names.\n3.  `values_to`: the name of a new column that will contain the values from the original columns.\n\nIn our case, here's what the code would look like:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# save the long format data as a variable so we can use it later\ngenes_long <- genes %>%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = contains(\"_rep\"),\n    names_to = \"measurement\",\n    values_to = \"expression\"\n  )\n\ngenes_long\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 3,087 × 4\n   group         id_num measurement expression\n   <chr>          <dbl> <chr>            <dbl>\n 1 grp_treatment      1 Th_rep1          3239.\n 2 grp_treatment      1 Th_rep2          5964.\n 3 grp_treatment      1 Th_rep3          4123.\n 4 grp_treatment      1 Prlh_rep1         225.\n 5 grp_treatment      1 Prlh_rep2         359.\n 6 grp_treatment      1 Prlh_rep3         314.\n 7 grp_treatment      1 Hprt1_rep1        858.\n 8 grp_treatment      1 Hprt1_rep2       1292.\n 9 grp_treatment      1 Hprt1_rep3        988.\n10 grp_treatment      2 Th_rep1          2665.\n# ℹ 3,077 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTake a moment to try and understand the values provided to each argument, then check your answer below ⬇️\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Solution</summary>\n\n1.  For the `cols` argument, we used the selection helper `contains(\"_rep\")` to select all columns containing the string `\"rep\"` (this saves us typing out all nine of the column names)\n2.  For the `names_to` argument, we decided to call this new column 'measurement', as it contains both the gene name and replicate (so is a unique measurement of a particular gene in a particular replicate)\n3.  For the `values_to` argument, we have called this new column 'expression level' as the numbers represent the gene expression in each of the different measurements\n\n</details>\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Perplexed by pivoting?\"}\nPivoting can be a bit tricky to get your head around! Often when you're doing analysis, you'll run into the problem of knowing that you need to pivot, but not knowing exactly what arguments to use. In these cases, it can be helpful to look at examples online, [like those in the R for Data Science book](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-tidy.html#sec-pivoting), ask an AI assistant or just try things until it works!\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important title=\"Practice exercises\"}\nTry these practice questions to test your understanding\n\n::: question\n1\\.

The code first calculates the median tail length for each unique combination of `mouse_strain` and `sex` in the `dosage` data frame, then pivots the data into a wide format where there is a column for each sex in the dataset (because of the argument `names_from = sex` )\n\n2\\. The correct pivot function call to take the data from a wide format to a long format is `pivot_longer(cols = c(initial_weight_g, final_weight_g), names_to = \"timepoint\", values_to = \"weight\")`. This code tells R to pivot the `initial_weight_g` and `final_weight_g` columns into a long format, where there is a row for each mouse and each weight measurement. The `names_to` argument specifies to make a column called 'timepoint' that tells us whether the measurement is initial or final, and the `values_to` argument specifies the name of the new column that will contain these measurements.\n\n3\\. Here's how you could write R code to achieve the tasks:\n\n```         \na.  `dosage %>% summarise(n_mice = n(), .by = c(mouse_strain, replicate))`\nb.  `dosage %>% summarise(n_mice = n(), .by = c(mouse_strain, replicate)) %>% pivot_wider(names_from = replicate, values_from = n_mice)`\nc.  `dosage %>% summarise(n_mice = n(), .by = c(mouse_strain, replicate)) %>% pivot_wider(names_from = replicate, values_from = n_mice) %>% pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"rep\"), names_to = \"replicate\", values_to = \"n_mice\")`\n```\n\n</details>\n\n:::\n\n### Separating data in a column {#sec-separate}\n\nNow that we've pivoted it into a long format, our `genes` data certainly looks a lot better! But, it's not quite tidy yet; recall that our for data to be tidy, [each column should contain only one variable](#sec-tidy-data). but our `measurement` column actually contains **two** pieces of information: the gene being measured and the replicate number, which are separated by an underscore. In order to make our data tidy, we can use the `separate()` function to split these into columns of their own.\n\nTo use the separate function, we need to give it three arguments:\n\n1.  The name of the column that needs to be separated (in this case, `measurement`)\n2.  `into`, which is a vector of the new column names that the data will be placed into\n3.  `sep`, which is the character that separates the two pieces of data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngenes_tidy <- genes_long %>%\n  separate(\n      measurement, \n      into = c(\"gene\", \"replicate\"), \n      sep = \"_\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can now see that the gene name and replicate are contained within their own columns, officially making the data tidy!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngenes_tidy\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 3,087 × 5\n   group         id_num gene  replicate expression\n   <chr>          <dbl> <chr> <chr>          <dbl>\n 1 grp_treatment      1 Th    rep1           3239.\n 2 grp_treatment      1 Th    rep2           5964.\n 3 grp_treatment      1 Th    rep3           4123.\n 4 grp_treatment      1 Prlh  rep1            225.\n 5 grp_treatment      1 Prlh  rep2            359.\n 6 grp_treatment      1 Prlh  rep3            314.\n 7 grp_treatment      1 Hprt1 rep1            858.\n 8 grp_treatment      1 Hprt1 rep2           1292.\n 9 grp_treatment      1 Hprt1 rep3            988.\n10 grp_treatment      2 Th    rep1           2665.\n# ℹ 3,077 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Combining data with join functions {#sec-join}\n\nTo address our [second research question](#sec-research-questions), we need to look at the relationship between gene expression data (in the `genes` data frame) and mouse strain (in the `dosage` data frame). But how can we achieve this when the information is contained across two separate data frames? So long as we have some way of connecting the observations in each data frame (i.e. a shared column), we can use the `join` family of functions to combine them.\n\nThere are many different types of `join` functions that you can use, but broadly they will either:\n\n-   Add new variables from one data frame to another\n-   Filter observations in one data frame based on whether or not they match observations in another data frame.\n-   Do both of these things at the same time\n\nProbably the most commonly used is the `left_join()` function. You need to provide it with two pieces of information:\n\n1.  The two data frames you want to join\n\n2.  The name of a column (or columns) to join by\n\nThe reason it's called a left-join is because it retains all rows from the left data frame while adding on columns from the right data frame only when the column you're joining by matches.\n\nFor example, in the following cartoon, where we are joining by column A:\n\n![The left_join() function allows you to combine two data frames](images/S04F03_left_join.png)\n\nWe can see that:\n\n-   A new column, D has been added from the right data frame\n-   All of the observations from the left data frame are present in the result\n-   The first row of the result contains an `NA` in the D column, because in the right data frame that the D column comes from, there is no matching observation 'a'\n-   The last row from the right data frame is missing from the result, because it has no matching value of 'd' in the left data frame\n\n::: {.callout-warning title=\"Beware multiple matches!\"}\nIf the values from the left data frame match to multiple rows of the column in the right data frame, the `left_join()` will duplicate the data from the left data frame for each match to the right. This can cause issues with downstream summarisation if not carefully considered.\n:::\n\nUsing this knowledge, let's try joining our `dosage` and `genes_tidy` data frames based on their shared column, `id_num` (an ID number uniquely assigned to each mouse):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# let's save the result of this as a variable\ncombined_data <- left_join(\n    genes_tidy, # the left data frame\n    dosage, # the right data frame\n    by = \"id_num\") # name of the column to join by\n\ncombined_data\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 3,087 × 13\n   group         id_num gene  replicate.x expression mouse_strain cage_number\n   <chr>          <dbl> <chr> <chr>            <dbl> <chr>        <chr>      \n 1 grp_treatment      1 Th    rep1             3239.

This is because both `genes_tidy` and `dosage` each contained their own replicate column, but we only told `left_join()` to match up our data by `id_num`.

For example what might be called \"id_num\" in one data frame could be called \"mouse_id\" in another data frame. In this case, the `by` argument of `left_join()` can be formatted using the `join_by(name1 == name2)` helper function to specify which column in the left data frame matches which column on the right.\n\nAs an example, we'll rename the `id_num` column in the `dosage` data frame to `mouse_id` and repeat the join to `genes_tidy`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# rename id_num to mouse_id\nrenamed_dosage <- dosage %>%\n  # we can use the rename() function to rename a column\n  rename(mouse_id = id_num)\n\n# now perform the left join\nleft_join(\n  genes_tidy, # left data frame \n  renamed_dosage, # right data frame\n  # join by the id_num column in genes_tidy, which is equivalent to the mouse_id column in renamed_dosage\n  by = join_by(id_num == mouse_id)) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 3,087 × 13\n   group         id_num gene  replicate.x expression mouse_strain cage_number\n   <chr>          <dbl> <chr> <chr>            <dbl> <chr>        <chr>      \n 1 grp_treatment      1 Th    rep1             3239.

The line of code that is NOT a valid way to join the `dosage` data frame with the `genes` data frame based on the `id_num` column is `dosage %>% left_join(genes, .by = \"id_num\")`. This line of code is incorrect because the `.by` argument is not used in the `left_join()` function (this can be confusing! it's `.by` when grouping by `by` when joining). The other options are valid ways to join the two data frames based on the `id_num` column: remember that we don't have to use pipes to join data frames, we can use the `left_join()` function directly, and we can use a named vector to specify the columns to join on (although here it's a bit redundant as the columns have the same name).\n\n2\\. To join the two data frames you could use `df1 %>% left_join(df2, by = c(\"key\" = \"item_key\"))` (with pipe) or `left_join(df1, df2, by = c(\"key\" = \"item_key\"))` (without pipe).\n\n</details>\n:::\n\n## The process of data analysis\n\nWith all that data wrangling out of the way, we can finally move on to doing some analysis to answer our [research questions](#sec-research-questions)! But wait— how do you actually *do* data analysis? Where should you start?\n\nWell, the creators of the tidyverse packages we use in this course have proposed the following 'process of data science':\n\n![The 'process of data science', according to the tidyverse (source: <https://r4ds.hadley.nz/intro.html#fig-ds-diagram>)](images/S04F04_analysis_steps.png)\n\nIn fact, we've already done the first two steps: reading in our data and tidying it up! The main portion of the analysis however is depicted as a cycle: transforming your data with the dplyr functions we learned in @sec-session02, visualising it with the ggplot2 functions we learned in @sec-session03, modelling it (with statistics, which we don't cover in this course as they're quite field-specific) and repeating. This process of iterating over many different research/analysis questions to develop a deeper understanding of your data allows you to really explore every aspect. Finally, you need to be able to clearly communicate the results of your analysis and interpret them in the biological context!\n\nAs we go through the research questions in the rest of this session, keep these steps in mind and try to think about how you could communicate the results.\n\n## Question 1: The relationship between dosage and weight loss\n\nLet's start by tackling the first part of our first research question: Does the amount of weight lost by mice increase as dosage of mousezempic increases?\n\nLuckily, our `dosage` data was pretty tidy already so we didn't have to do much cleaning. To begin our analysis process, let's try investigating the relationship between these variables with visualisation. As both the dosage and weight loss variables are continuous, we can represent them on a scatterplot using `geom_point()`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(dosage, aes(x = drug_dose_g, y = weight_lost_g)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](session_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png){width=2000}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can clearly see a positive linear relationship between drug dosage and weight lost.\n\nHowever, this plot certainly isn't publication ready! Practice the R skills you have learned throughout the course so far and try to improve the look of the plot by working through the exercises below ⬇️\n\n::: {.callout-important title=\"Practice exercise: changing the x axis\"}\nFor starters, it would probably make more sense to display the drug doses in milligrams rather than in grams, given that the values are so small. Take a moment to think about how you might achieve this using the dplyr functions we learned in session 2, and then check your answer below.\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Solution</summary>\n\nTo convert g to mg we need to multiply by 1000. So, we need some kind of function that allows us to take the existing `drug_dose_g` column and multiply it by 1000 to create a new column that we can use for our plotting.\n\n1\\. Use the `mutate()` function to create a new column in the `dosage` data frame called (for example) `drug_dose_mg`\n\n2\\. Either save the modified `dosage` data frame as a variable in R, or pipe it directly into the ggplot function call\n\n3\\. Make the ggplot as before\n\n</details>\n\nLearning how to break a problem down into simple steps is a crucial skill to learn for data analysis! Even if there are some steps that you don't immediately know how to solve with code, it gives you a good starting point for your googling or to ask ChatGPT.\n\nNow, try to convert these steps into code and create a plot where the x axis displays the drug dose in mg, like this one:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](session_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=2000}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Solution</summary>\n\nFollowing the steps outlined above, here are two example code chunks that will make the correct plot. There are of course many more ways to approach the problem, so it's ok if your solution doesn't match perfectly!\n\nThis first solution saves the modified dosage data as a new data frame, which could be useful if you want to use the `drug_dose_mg` column in other plots or calculations:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# step two: save the modified version of dosage as its own \ndosage_mg <- dosage %>%\n  # step one: use mutate to create drug_dose_mg column\n  mutate(drug_dose_mg = drug_dose_g * 1000)\n\n  # step three: plot same as before\n  ggplot(dosage_mg, aes(x = drug_dose_mg, y = weight_lost_g)) +\n    geom_point()\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe second one instead pipes this data frame directly from the `mutate()` function call straight into the `ggplot()` function. This approach is convenient when the data manipulation you're doing (in this case adding the `drug_dose_mg` column) is only for a specific plot, so you don't clutter up your environment panel:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndosage %>%\n  # step one: use mutate to create drug_dose_mg column\n  mutate(drug_dose_mg = drug_dose_g * 1000) %>%\n\n  # step two: pipe directly into the ggplot() function\n  # note that because the pipe passes our modified dosage data in as the first argument,\n  # we don't need to specify the data frame we are plotting, just the aes() \n  ggplot(aes(x = drug_dose_mg, y = weight_lost_g)) +\n\n  # step three: plot same as before \n    geom_point()\n```\n:::\n\n\n</details>\n\nNow our x axis is much easier to read!\n:::\n\nStill, there are a few things we could do to make our plot look a bit better. In the next set of practice problems, we will use our ggplot2 knowledge to improve the plot visually:\n\n::: {.callout-important title=\"Practice exercise: making visual improvements\"}\nTake a moment to look at the plot and think of what you could change to make it more informative and visually appealing.

The plot could do with some nicely formatted labels on the x and y axes, as well as a title.\n\n2\\. Some of the points on the plot are overlapping, so it could be helpful to change the points from filled circles to unfilled circles so they don't all just merge into a blob.\n\n3\\.

Above, we learned how to use the `summarise()` and `pivot_wider()` functions to create a contingency table that counts up how many mice fall into each of the mouse strain/sex combinations. This is an important first step for the analysis, as it allows us to double check that there isn't a category with so few mice that would prevent us from drawing reliable conclusions.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndosage %>%\n  summarise(n_mice = n(), .by = c(mouse_strain, sex)) %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = mouse_strain, values_from = n_mice)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 3 × 4\n  sex    `CD-1` `Black 6` `BALB C`\n  <chr>   <int>     <int>    <int>\n1 male       73        61       34\n2 female     73        58       34\n3 <NA>        6         5       NA\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGiven that there are >30 mice in each category, we can proceed with the analysis.\n\n::: {.callout-important title=\"Practice exercise: adding in extra information\"}\n\nNow, let's try adding the mouse strain and sex information to the scatterplot we created above. Try to think about what aesthetics would be good to use to show those two variables.\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Solution</summary>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# see the previous practice q for the explanation of this\n# dplyr code to create the mg column\ndosage %>%\n  mutate(drug_dose_mg = drug_dose_g * 1000) %>%\n  # create the plot\n  ggplot(aes(x = drug_dose_mg, y = weight_lost_g, colour = mouse_strain, shape = sex)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    # add axis labels and title\n    labs(title = \"Association between drug dosage and weight lost\",\n       x = \"Drug dosage (mg)\",\n       y = \"Weight lost (g)\",\n       # adding nicer labels to the legend\n       # you just use the aesthetic name \n       colour = \"Mouse strain\",\n       shape = \"Sex\") +\n    # change the theme\n    theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](session_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png){width=2000}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that:\n\n- It's up to you which aesthetics should represent each variable, but in this example the `colour` aesthetic was chosen for the mouse strains because there are more strains than sexes, and it's easier to distinguish between different colours than different shapes\n\n- We used the `labs()` function to change the legend labels for our mouse strain and sex variables. It just gives a nice professional touch to the plot\n\n</details>\n\n:::\n\nOur plot reveals that Black 6 mice received higher drug dosages than the other mice, and also lost more weight. This shows us why it's so important to explore the relationships between lots of different variables in large datasets. Imagine if we had just plotted the weight loss for mice of each strain:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(dosage, aes(x = mouse_strain, y = weight_lost_g)) + \n  geom_boxplot() + \n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](session_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png){width=2000}\n:::\n:::\n\nWe might think that the drug is more effective on Black 6 mice, because they lost more weight, but our scatterplot above shows it's more likely to be due to their higher dosage.\n\nAlways try to look at all the variables you have, because you never know what associations you might find!\n\n## Question 2: The effect of mousezempic on gene expression\nOur second research question was about the effect of mousezempic on the expression of the TH and PRLH genes. To answer this question, we can use the `genes_tidy` dataset that we prepared in @sec-reshaping, by pivoting the `genes` dataset to be longer and separating the measurement column so each variable is contained within its own column.\n\nLet's take a look at the `genes_tidy` data to remind ourselves of the information it contains. You might like to use the `View()` function, or just type the name of the data like so:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngenes_tidy\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 3,087 × 5\n   group         id_num gene  replicate expression\n   <chr>          <dbl> <chr> <chr>          <dbl>\n 1 grp_treatment      1 Th    rep1           3239.\n 2 grp_treatment      1 Th    rep2           5964.\n 3 grp_treatment      1 Th    rep3           4123.\n 4 grp_treatment      1 Prlh  rep1            225.\n 5 grp_treatment      1 Prlh  rep2            359.\n 6 grp_treatment      1 Prlh  rep3            314.\n 7 grp_treatment      1 Hprt1 rep1            858.\n 8 grp_treatment      1 Hprt1 rep2           1292.\n 9 grp_treatment      1 Hprt1 rep3            988.\n10 grp_treatment      2 Th    rep1           2665.\n# ℹ 3,077 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nEach mouse has a unique `id_num`, and belongs to a `group` (either treatment or control). There are also gene expression measurements in triplicate for each of three different genes: the TH and PRLH genes we are interested in and HPRT1, a housekeeping gene.\n\n### Do the treatment and control groups differ?\nTo investigate differences in gene expression between the treatment an control groups, a good first step would be to make a plot. Boxplots, violin plots or beeswarm plots would be a good choice to visualise this type of data.\n\n::: {.callout-important title=\"Practice exercise: plotting the relationship between mousezempic and gene expression\"}\n\nTake a moment to think about how you could achieve this, and check your answer below. As an additional exercise, how could you prevent the HPRT1 gene from being shown on your plot?\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Solution</summary>\n\nSince we want to plot the expression of two different genes, we have a couple of options.\n\nFirstly, we could use a single `ggplot()` function call, and facet the plot by the gene. However, if we want to exlude the HPRT1 gene, we'll have to first use the `filter()` function from dplyr to remove it from our data frame.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngenes_tidy %>%\n  # remember that != is the test for inequality in R\n  # also note we use Hprt1 not HPRT1: needs to match \n  # the data frame exactly for filter() to work\n  filter(gene != \"Hprt1\") %>%\n  # we will pipe this filtered data into the ggplot\n  # because we are unlikely to want to re-use it\n  ggplot(aes(x = group, y = expression)) +\n    geom_boxplot() +\n    # to facet write ~ then the name of the column\n    # need scales = \"free\" because otherwise it will\n    # use the same scales for both genes, and the \n    # expression levels are quite different\n    facet_wrap(~ gene, scales = \"free\") +\n    theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](session_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png){width=2000}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnother option would be to plot each of TH and PRLH separately, with two different `ggplot()` function calls and then combine them with patchwork (make sure this package is loaded!). To do this, we would also have to use the `filter()` function, this time to filter to just the rows that contain the gene we want to plot \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# first plot: TH\nth_plot <- genes_tidy %>%\n  # == tests for equality in R \n  filter(gene == \"Th\") %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = group, y = expression)) +\n    geom_boxplot() + \n    # should add a title to remind us which one this is\n    labs(title = \"TH gene expression in control vs treatment groups\") +\n    theme_bw()\n\n# second plot: PRLH\nprlh_plot <- genes_tidy %>%\n  # == tests for equality in R \n  filter(gene == \"Prlh\") %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = group, y = expression)) +\n    geom_boxplot() + \n    # should add a title to remind us which one this is\n    labs(\n      title = \"PRLH gene expression in control vs treatment groups\") +\n    theme_bw()\n\n# combine them using patchwork + syntax\nth_plot + prlh_plot\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](session_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png){width=2000}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe first method with faceting requires less code, but the second method of making two separate plots that are combined with patchwork allows you to be more flexible with the layout and  include extra plots in the figure if desired.\n\nBut either solution is perfectly valid, and allows us to see that the expression of the Th and Prlh genes is higher in the treatment group than in the control group.\n\n</details>\n\n:::\n\nR also provides a range of functions that we could use to formally test the relationship between these variables, although they are out of the scope of this course. A helpful guide on performing statistical tests in R [can be found here](https://epirhandbook.com/en/new_pages/stat_tests.html#base-r).\n\n### An aside: string manipulation\nLet's now take a moment to improve the appearance of our plot from the exercise above:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](session_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png){width=2000}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn session three we learned how to change the x and y axis labels on our graph to be more informative, but how can we change the values on the axes themselves? Currently, we have 'grp_control' and 'grp_treatment', but to make the plot look more publication-ready, it would be nice if it could just say 'Control' and 'Treatment'.\n\nWe can do this with the help of the [stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/) tidyverse package, which contains a set of functions to manipulate string (character) data in R. Being able to programatically manipulate strings is an essential tool for dealing with real-world data, particularly when you need to extract sample information from names or (as in our case) remove irrelevant characters that only take up space on plots.\n\nSome useful functions for string manipulation include:\n\n-   `str_replace(string, pattern, replacement)`: replaces the `pattern` in the `string` with the `replacement`\n-   `str_extract(string, pattern)`: extracts the part of the `string` matching the `pattern`\n-   `str_remove(string, pattern)`: removes the part of the `string` matching the `pattern`\n\nThe full list of functions can be found in the [stringr package documentation](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html).\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Using stringr functions on a data frame\"}\n\nRemember from session 2 that when we use the pipe operator `%>%`, it passes whatever precedes it into the function after it as the first argument. This means that the functions we use within a chain of pipes on a data frame should (generally) have a data frame as their input, and return a data frame as their output.\n\nBut stringr functions operate on character vectors (their first argument is `string`, as shown above), so how can we use them on our data frames? The answer is to wrap it in the `mutate()` function from the dplyr package, which allows us to either edit an exisiting column or create a new one based on our string manipulation.\n\nFor example, let's say we want to change the replicate column in our `genes_tidy` data frame to read 'Replicate 1', 'Replicate 2', etc instead of 'rep1', 'rep2'. We would do this by using the `str_replace()` function inside the `mutate()` function like so:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngenes_tidy %>%\n  mutate(replicate = str_replace(replicate, \"rep\", \"Replicate \"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 3,087 × 5\n   group         id_num gene  replicate   expression\n   <chr>          <dbl> <chr> <chr>            <dbl>\n 1 grp_treatment      1 Th    Replicate 1      3239.\n 2 grp_treatment      1 Th    Replicate 2      5964.\n 3 grp_treatment      1 Th    Replicate 3      4123.\n 4 grp_treatment      1 Prlh  Replicate 1       225.\n 5 grp_treatment      1 Prlh  Replicate 2       359.\n 6 grp_treatment      1 Prlh  Replicate 3       314.\n 7 grp_treatment      1 Hprt1 Replicate 1       858.\n 8 grp_treatment      1 Hprt1 Replicate 2      1292.\n 9 grp_treatment      1 Hprt1 Replicate 3       988.\n10 grp_treatment      2 Th    Replicate 1      2665.\n# ℹ 3,077 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis applies to lots of other functions, not just the ones from the stringr package--- if you want to use a function that takes a vector as input on a column of a data frame, wrap it in the `mutate()` function first!\n\n:::\n\n'Patterns' are what the stringr package will look for in your `string`. For example, in this case, our pattern could be `grp_` because this is what we want to remove from the strings in our 'group' column. This is an example of a **fixed pattern**, where you specify exactly what string you want to find. There is also another way to write patterns, called [**regular expressions**](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html#matching-patterns-with-regular-expressions) which allow you to, for example, remove everything before the first underscore or all numbers. These are extremely powerful, but can get a little confusing so you might like to get help from AI to write them.\n\n::: {.callout-important title=\"Cleaning up the text on our plot\"}\n\nUsing the stringr package, remove the 'grp_' from the x axis labels, and then use ggplot2 functions to add other labels to the plot. Here's an example of what this might look like:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](session_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png){width=2000}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Solution</summary>\n\nThe code that generates the plot above is:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngenes_tidy %>%\n  # use str_remove function to remove 'grp_' from the \n  # beginning of the group column. need to wrap it in\n  # the mutate function because we are working on a \n  # column in a data frame not just on a vector \n  mutate(group = str_remove(group, \"grp_\")) %>%\n  filter(gene != \"Hprt1\") %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = group, y = expression)) +\n    geom_boxplot() +\n    facet_wrap(~ gene, scales = \"free\") +\n    theme_bw() +\n    # add the other labels \n    labs(\n      title = \"Effect of mousezempic on gene expression\",\n      x = \"Group\", \n      y = \"Expression (arbitrary units)\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n</details>\n\n:::\n\n### The relationship between gene expression and weight loss\nThe second part of research question 2 asked us to look at whether TH and/or PRLH expression is associated with the amount of weight lost by mice taking mousezempic. To do this, we will need to use the `combined_data` that we generated in @sec-join, which is the result of joining the `dosage` and `genes_tidy` data frames. \n\n::: {.callout-important title=\"Plotting the relationship between gene expression and weight loss\"}\n\nUse the `combined_data` data frame and your choice of ggplot2 functions to see whether there is a relationship between the expression of the TH & PRLH genes and weight lost by mice.\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Solution</summary>\n\nSince both variables are continuous, a scatterplot is a good choice to visualise their relationship. Here is some sample code:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# first plot: TH\nth_plot <- combined_data %>%\n  # == tests for equality in R \n  filter(gene == \"Th\") %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = expression, y = weight_lost_g)) +\n    geom_point() + \n    labs(\n      x = \"TH gene expression (arbitrary units)\",\n      y = \"Weight loss (g)\") +\n    theme_minimal()\n\n# second plot: PRLH\nprlh_plot <- combined_data %>%\n  filter(gene == \"Prlh\") %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = expression, y = weight_lost_g)) +\n    geom_point() + \n    labs(\n      x = \"PRLH gene expression (arbitrary units)\",\n      y = \"Weight loss (g)\") +\n    theme_minimal()\n\n# combine them using patchwork + syntax\nth_plot + prlh_plot\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Removed 6 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\nRemoved 6 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](session_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-30-1.png){width=2000}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can se there is no association between the expression of TH and weight lost, and the same is true for PRLH expression and weight lost. This probably makes sense, as there are many complex regulatory pathways involved in hunger.\n\n</details>\n\n:::\n\n\n## Summary\nToday, we've tried to put together all of the skills we've learned in this R course and use them to address some sample data analysis questions. We've covered:\n\n-   The concept of tidy data, that is stored in a consistent format so that we can easily analyse it with functions from the tidyverse\n\n-   How to reshape data frames using the `pivot_wider()`, `pivot_longer()` and `separate()` functions\n\n-   How to merge data frames with common columns using the `left_join()` function \n\n-   The 'stringr' package for string manipulation, and some of the basic ways we can use it to clean up character columns in our data frames\n\n-   The overall process of data science, and how to apply it in practice to break down our research questions into a series of steps/function calls in R \n\nOf course, a real data analysis will likely be much longer and more complex than the toy examples we have tackled today. However, we hope that it has provided you with a basic, yet versatile toolkit for transforming the messy data you will find in the wild into a neat, tidy format that you can use to explore your research questions and produce gorgeous data visualisations. \n\n<!--\n### Practice questions\nIf you have time, try having a go at addressing these additional research questions.
