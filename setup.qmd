2.  Move it to wherever you like on your computer
3.  Unzip it (on mac: double-click, on windows: right-click, then click extract all)

If for whatever reason you need to download the data files separately, here they are. The paths used in this course assume they are named as-is and located in a folder called 'data' that exists in the current working directory.
