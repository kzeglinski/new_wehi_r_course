# Working with data - Part 2 {#sec-chapter03}

In this chapter we will continue learning how to manipulate and summarise data using the `dplyr` package (with a little help from the `tidyr` package too).

::: {.callout-tip title="Learning Objectives"}
At the end of this chapter, learners should be able to:

1.  Apply grouping for more complex analysis of data

2.  Save data frames to a file
:::

Let's first load the tidyverse
```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
```

...and read in the MouseZempic® dosage data

```{r}
#| eval: false
# read in the data, like we did in chapter 1
m_dose <- read_delim("data/mousezempic_dosage_data.csv")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
# just for rendering the book not for students to see
m_dose <- read_delim("data/mousezempic_dosage_data.csv")
```


## Modifying data {#sec-mutate}

So far, we've learned how to filter rows and select columns from a data frame. But what if we want to change the data itself? This is where the `mutate()` function comes in.

![Mutate allows you to add new columns to a data frame](images/S02F07_mutate.png)

The `mutate()` function is used to add new columns to a data frame, or modify existing columns, often by performing some sort of calculation. For example, we can add a new column to `m_dose` that contains the drug dose in mg (rather than g):

```{r}
m_dose %>%
  # add a new column called drug_dose_mg
  # convert drug_dose_g to mg by multiplying by 1000
  mutate(drug_dose_mg = drug_dose_g * 1000) %>%
  # just select the drug dose columns so we can compare them
  select(drug_dose_g, drug_dose_mg)
```

You can see that the `drug_dose_mg` column has been added to the data frame, and it contains, for each row, the value of the `drug_dose_g` column multiplied by 1000 (`NA` values are preserved).

These calculations can be as complex as you like, and involve multiple different columns. For example, to add a new column to the `m_dose` data frame that calculates the weight lost as a percentage of the initial weight:

```{r}
m_dose %>%
  # calculate the % of initial weight that was lost
  mutate(weight_lost_percent = (weight_lost_g / initial_weight_g) * 100)
```

A useful helper function for `mutate()` is the `case_when()` function, which allows you to create new columns based on multiple conditions. We do this with the notation `case_when(condition1 ~ value1, condition2 ~ value2, ...)`.

For example, to add a new column to the `m_dose` data frame that categorises the mice based on how much weight they lost:

```{r}
m_dose %>%
  # create a new column called weight_loss_category
  mutate(weight_loss_category = case_when(
    weight_lost_g < 4 ~ "Low", # separate conditions with a comma
    weight_lost_g <= 5 ~ "Medium",
    weight_lost_g > 5 ~ "High"
  )) %>%
  select(weight_lost_g, weight_loss_category)
```

Note that the conditions are evaluated in order, and the first condition that is `TRUE` is the one that is used. So if a mouse lost 4.5g, it `case_when()` would first test if it fits the 'Low' category (by checking if 4.5 is less than 4, which it isn't), and then if it fits the 'Medium' category (by checking if 4.5 is less than or equal to 5). Since it is, the mouse would be categorised as 'Medium'.

::: {.callout-note title="Fallback with default value(s)"}
In the above example, what would happen if a mouse lost -1g (gained weight)? It wouldn't fit any of the conditions, so it would get an `NA` in the `weight_loss_category` column. Sometimes you might want this behaviour, but other times you would prefer to specify a 'fallback' category that will be assigned to everything that doesn't fit in the other categories. You can do this by including a ` .default = ` argument at the end of the `case_when()` function. For example:

```{r}
m_dose %>%
  # create a new column called weight_loss_category
  mutate(weight_loss_category = case_when(
    weight_lost_g < 4 ~ "Low", # separate conditions with a comma
    weight_lost_g <= 5 ~ "Medium",
    weight_lost_g > 5 ~ "High",
    .default = "Unknown"
  )) %>%
  select(weight_lost_g, weight_loss_category)
```

Notice how the `NA` value in the fourth row is now categorised as 'Unknown'.
:::

One final thing to note is that `mutate()` can be used to modify existing columns as well as add new ones. To do this, just use the name of the existing column as the 'new' one.

For example, let's use `mutate()` together with `case_when()` to modify the `sex` column so that it uses `M` and `F` instead `male` and `female`:

```{r}
m_dose %>%
  # modify sex column
  mutate(sex = case_when(
    sex == "female" ~ "F",
    sex == "male" ~ "M",
    # if neither, code it as 'X'
    .default = "X"))
```

<p>

1.  The correct line of code to add a new column to the `m_dose` data frame that converts the `tail_length_mm` column to cm is `m_dose %>% mutate(tail_length_cm = tail_length_mm / 10)`.
2.  The code `m_dose %>% arrange(desc(weight_lost_g)) %>% mutate(weight_lost_rank = row_number())` adds a new column to the data frame that ranks the mice based on how much weight they lost, with 1 being the mouse that lost the most weight. First, the `arrange(desc(weight_lost_g))` function sorts the data frame by the `weight_lost_g` column in descending order, and then the `mutate(weight_lost_rank = row_number())` function adds a new column that assigns a rank to each row based on its position (row number) in the sorted data frame.
3.  The error is that the conditions in the `case_when()` function are not separated by commas. Each condition should be followed by a comma because these are like the arguments in a function. Remeber that it's optional to include the `.default =` condition at the end of the `case_when()` function.
4.  The code `m_dose %>% mutate(mouse_strain = case_when(mouse_strain == "Black 6" ~ "B6", .default = mouse_strain))` modifies the `mouse_strain` column so that any mice from the "Black 6" strain are now called "B6", and all other strains are left unchanged. As we are calling our column `mouse_strain`, no new column is being created (we are modifying the existing one) and the `.default = mouse_strain` condition acts as a fallback to keep the original values (that already exist in the `mouse_strain` column) for any rows that don't match our first condition (strain being "Black 6").

## Summarising data {#sec-summarise}

![Summarise allows you to calculate summary statistics that collapse many rows into one](images/S02F08_summarise.png)

The `summarise()` (or `summarize()`, if you prefer US spelling) function is used to calculate summary statistics on your data. It takes similar arguments to `mutate()`, but instead of adding a new column to the data frame, it returns a new data frame with a single row and one column for each summary statistic you calculate.

For example, to calculate the mean weight lost by the mice in the `m_dose` data frame:

```{r}
m_dose %>%
  summarise(mean_weight_lost = mean(weight_lost_g, na.rm = TRUE))
```

We can also calculate multiple summary statistics at once. For example, to calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the weight lost by the mice:

```{r}
m_dose %>%
  summarise(
    mean_weight_lost = mean(weight_lost_g, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_weight_lost = median(weight_lost_g, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_weight_lost = sd(weight_lost_g, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

The power of summarising data is really seen when combined with grouping, which we will cover in the next section.

1\. The code **produces a data frame** containing one column for each of the average, minimum, and maximum tail length of the mice in the `m_dose` data frame.

2\. The line of code that is NOT a valid way to calculate the mean weight lost by the mice in the `m_dose` data frame is `m_dose %>% mean(weight_lost_g, na.rm = TRUE)`. This line of code is incorrect because the `mean()` function is being used directly on the data frame, rather than within a `summarise()` function. The other options are valid ways to calculate the mean weight lost by the mice in the `m_dose` data frame (although note that the second option uses `pull()` to extract the `weight_lost_g` column as a vector before calculating the mean, so the mean value is stored in a vector rather than in a data frame).

## Grouping {#sec-grouping}

![Using summarise with the .by option allows you to create separate summaries for different 'groups' of data](images/S02F09_grouped_summarise.png)

Grouping is a powerful concept in in `dplyr` that allows you to perform operations on subsets of your data. For example, you might want to calculate the mean weight lost by mice in each cage, or find the mouse with the longest tail in each strain.

We can group data using the `.by` argument that exists in many dplyr functions, like `summarise()` and `mutate()`, and passing it the name(s) of column(s) to group by. For example, to calculate the mean weight lost by mice in each cage:

```{r}
m_dose %>%
  summarise(
    mean_weight_lost = mean(weight_lost_g, na.rm = TRUE),
    # don't forget it's .by, not by!
    .by = cage_number)
```

Like when we first learned the summarise function above, we give our new column a name (`mean_weight_lost`), and then we assign its value to be the mean of the `weight_lost_g` column (with `NA`s removed). But this time, we also added the `.by` argument to specify the column we want to group by (`cage_number`, in this case). This will return a data frame with the mean weight lost by mice in each cage.

Grouping is a powerful tool for exploring your data and can help you identify patterns that might not be obvious when looking at the data as a whole. For example, notice how this grouped summary reveals that mice in cage 3E lost more weight than those in the other two cages.

It's also possible to group by multiple columns by passing a vector of column names to the `.by` argument. For example, to calculate the mean weight lost by mice in each cage and strain:

```{r}
m_dose %>%
  summarise(mean_weight_lost = mean(weight_lost_g, na.rm = TRUE),
  # group by both cage_number and mouse_strain
    .by = c(cage_number, mouse_strain))
```

Of course, `mean()` is not the only function that we can use within `summarise()`. We can use any function that takes a vector of values and returns a single value, like `median()`, `sd()`, or `max()`. We can also use multiple functions at once, by giving each column a name and specifying the function we want to use:

```{r}
m_dose %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean_weight_lost = mean(weight_lost_g, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_weight_lost = median(weight_lost_g, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_weight_lost = sd(weight_lost_g, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_weight_lost = max(weight_lost_g, na.rm = TRUE),
    min_weight_lost = min(weight_lost_g, na.rm = TRUE),
    .by = cage_number)
```

Here, we also used the `n()` function to calculate the number of mice in each cage. This is a special helper function that works within `summarise` to count the number of rows in each group.

::: {.callout-note title="To `.by` or not to `.by`?"}
In the `dplyr` package, there are two ways to group data: using the `.by` argument within various functions (as we have covered so far), or using the `group_by()` function, then performing your operations and ungrouping with `ungroup()`.

For example, we've seen above how to calculate the mean weight lost by mice in each cage using the `.by` argument:

```{r}
m_dose %>%
  summarise(mean_weight_lost = mean(weight_lost_g, na.rm = TRUE), .by = cage_number)
```

But we can also do the same using `group_by()` and `ungroup()`:
```{r}
m_dose %>%
  group_by(cage_number) %>%
  summarise(mean_weight_lost = mean(weight_lost_g, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

The two methods are equivalent, but using the `.by` argument within functions can be more concise and easier to read. Still, it's good to be aware of `group_by()` and `ungroup()` as they are widely used, particularly in older code.

:::

Although grouping is most often used with `summarise()`, it can be used with `dplyr` functions too. For example mutate() function can also be used with grouping to add new columns to the data frame based on group-specific calculations. Let's say we wanted to calculate the Z-score (also known as the [standard score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score)) to standardise the weight lost by each mouse within each strain.

As a reminder, the formula for calculating the Z-score is $\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$, where $x$ is the value (in our case the `weight_lost_g` column), $\mu$ is the mean, and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation.

We can calculate this for each mouse in each strain using the following code:

```{r}
m_dose %>%
  # remove NAs before calculating the mean and SD
  filter(!is.na(weight_lost_g)) %>%
  mutate(weight_lost_z = (weight_lost_g - mean(weight_lost_g)) / sd(weight_lost_g), .by = mouse_strain) %>%
  # select the relevant columns
  select(mouse_strain, weight_lost_g, weight_lost_z)
```

Unlike when we used `.by` with `summarise()`, we still get the same number of rows as the original data frame, but now we have a new column `weight_lost_z` that contains the Z-score for each mouse within each strain. This could be useful for identifying outliers or comparing the weight lost by each mouse to the average for its strain.

The correct line of code to calculate the median tail length of mice belonging to each strain in the `m_dose` data frame is `m_dose %>% summarise(median_tail_length = median(tail_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE), .by = mouse_strain)`. Remember to use `na.rm = TRUE` to remove any missing values before calculating the median, and to use `.by` to specify the column to group by (not `by`). Seeing as we want to calculate the median (collapse down to a single value per group), we need to use `summarise()` rather than `mutate()`.
2.  The code `m_dose %>% summarise(max_tail_len = max(tail_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE), .by = c(mouse_strain, replicate))` calculates the maximum tail length of mice in each **unique combination** of strain and replicate in the `m_dose` data frame.

We use `mutate()` because we want a value for each mouse (each row in our data), rather than to collapse down to a single value for each group (cage number in this case). Be careful that you use the `.by` argument within the `mutate()` function call, not within the `sum()` function by mistake (this is what is wrong with the third option).

## Saving data to a file {#sec-saving}

Once you've cleaned and transformed your data, you'll often want to save it to a file so that you can use it in other programs or share it with others. The `write_csv()` and `write_tsv()` functions from the `readr` package are a great way to do this. They take two arguments - the data frame you want to save and the file path where you want to save it.

For example, let's say I want to save my summary table of the weight lost by mice in each cage to a CSV file called `cage_summary_table.csv`:

```{r}
#| eval: false
# create the summary table
# and assign it to a variable
cage_summary_table <- m_dose %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean_weight_lost = mean(weight_lost_g, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_weight_lost = median(weight_lost_g, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_weight_lost = sd(weight_lost_g, na.rm = TRUE),
    .by = cage_number)

# save the data to a CSV file
write_csv(cage_summary_table, "cage_summary_table.csv")
```

CSV files are particularly great because they can be easily read into other software, like Excel.

It's also possible to use the `write_*()` functions along with a pipe:

```{r}
#| eval: false
m_dose %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean_weight_lost = mean(weight_lost_g, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_weight_lost = median(weight_lost_g, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_weight_lost = sd(weight_lost_g, na.rm = TRUE),
    .by = cage_number) %>%
  write_csv("cage_summary_table.csv")
```
Remember here that the first argument (the data frame to save) is passed on by the pipe, so the only argument in the brackets is the second one: the file path.

## Summary
Here's what we've covered in this chapter:

-   The pipe operator `%>%` and how we can use it to chain together multiple function calls, making our code more readable and easier to understand.

-   The basic dplyr verbs `filter()`, `select()`, `mutate()`, and `arrange()` and how they can be used to tidy and analyse data.

-   Missing values (`NA`) and how to remove or replace them

-   The `summarise()` function and how it can be used to calculate summary statistics on your data, as well as the power of grouping data with the `.by` argument.

::: {.callout-note title="Why does data need to be tidy anyway?"}
In this chapter, we've been focusing on making our data 'tidy': that is, structured in a consistent way that makes it easy to work with. A nice visual illustration of tidy data and its importance can be [found here](https://allisonhorst.com/other-r-fun).
:::

### Practice questions

1.  What is the purpose of the pipe operator `%>%`? Keeping this in mind, re-write the following code to use the pipe.

    a.  `round(mean(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)))`
    b.  `print(as.character(1 + 10))`

2.  What would be the result of evaluating the following expressions? You don't need to know these off the top of your head, use R to help! (Hint: some expressions might give an error. Try to think about why)

    a.  `m_dose %>% filter(weight_lost_g > 10)`
    b.  `m_dose %>% select(tail_length_mm, weight_lost_g)`
    c.  `m_dose %>% mutate(weight_lost_kg = weight_lost_g / 1000)`
    d.  `m_dose %>% arrange(tail_length_mm)`
    e.  `m_dose %>% filter(initial_Weight_g > 10) %>% arrange(mouse_strain)`
    f.  `m_dose %>% relocate(mouse_strain, .after = cage_number)`
    g.  `m_dose %>% pull(weight_lost_g)`
    h.  `m_dose %>% filter(!is.na(weight_lost_g))`
    i.  `m_dose %>% replace_na(list(weight_lost_g = 0))`
    j.  `m_dose %>% summarise(mean_weight_lost = mean(weight_lost_g, na.rm = TRUE))`
    k.  `m_dose %>% summarise(mean_weight_lost = mean(weight_lost_g, na.rm = TRUE), .by = cage_number)`

3.  What is a missing value in R? What are two ways to deal with missing values in a data frame?

4.  I want to add a new column to the `m_dose` data frame that converts the `mouse_strain` column to lowercase. Hint: you can use the `tolower()` function in R to convert characters to lowercase. Look up its help page by typing `?tolower` in the R console to see how to use it.

5. How could you find the maximum tail length for each unique combination of sex and mouse strain in the `m_dose` data frame?

6. Write a line of code to save the result of Q5 to a CSV file called `max_tail_length.csv`.

1. The pipe operator `%>%` is used to chain together multiple function calls, passing the result of one function to the next. Here's how you could re-write the code to use the pipe:

    a.  `c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) %>% mean() %>% round()`
    b.  `as.character(1 + 10) %>% print()`

2. The result of evaluating the expressions would be:
    a. A data frame containing only the rows where `weight_lost_g` is greater than 10.
    b. A data frame containing only the `tail_length_mm` and `weight_lost_g` columns.
    c. A data frame with an additional column `weight_lost_kg` that contains the weight lost in kilograms.
    d. A data frame sorted by `tail_length_mm`, in ascending order.
    e. An error because `initial_Weight_g` is not a column in the data frame.
    f. A data frame with the `mouse_strain` column moved to be after the `cage_number` column.
    g. A **vector** containing the values of the `weight_lost_g` column.
    h. A data frame containing only the rows where `weight_lost_g` is not `NA`.
    i. A data frame with missing values in the `weight_lost_g` column replaced with 0.
    j. A data frame with the mean weight lost by all mice.
    k. A data frame with the mean weight lost by mice in each cage.

3. A missing value in R is represented by `NA`. Two ways to deal with missing values in a data frame are to remove them using `filter(!is.na(column_name))` or to replace them with a specific value using `replace_na(list(column_name = value))`.

4. To add a new column to the `m_dose` data frame that converts the `mouse_strain` column to lowercase, you can use `mutate()` as follows`:

```{r}
m_dose %>%
  mutate(mouse_strain_lower = tolower(mouse_strain))
```

5. You can use the `max()` function within `summarise(.by = c(sex, mouse_strain))` to find the maximum tail length of each unique sex/mouse strain combination:

```{r}
m_dose %>%
  summarise(max_tail_length = max(tail_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE), .by = c(sex, mouse_strain))
```

6. To save the result of Q5 to a CSV file called `max_tail_length.csv`, you can use the `write_csv()` function, either by using a pipe to connect it to the code you wrote previously:
```{r}
#| eval: false
m_dose %>%
  summarise(max_tail_length = max(tail_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE), .by = c(sex, mouse_strain)) %>%
  write_csv("max_tail_length.csv")
```

Or by assigning this result to a variable and then saving it to a file:
```{r}
#| eval: false
max_tail_length <- m_dose %>%
  summarise(max_tail_length = max(tail_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE), .by = c(sex, mouse_strain))

write_csv(max_tail_length, "max_tail_length.csv")
```
